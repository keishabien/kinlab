            <p class="client_description">Mia and Steven came to kinlab to have their first child together. Mia has poor
                eyesight and didn't want to pass that on to her child. Steven's family has a history of heart disease
                and didn't want his baby to be at risk. They worked closely with our expert geneticists to make sure
                their baby was perfect. </p>

            <p class="client_description">
                The Miller family really wanted a baby girl. Jeff Miller was one of six boys growing up and wanted his
                son to have a sister to play with. The family opted to choose the sex of their baby and to prevent
                health issues. They are so excited to watch their little one grow up.

            <p class="client_description">Jenna and Martin always wanted a small family so perfecting their baby was
                important. Martin's family has a history of Alzheimers and the kinlab team was able to remove the genes
                responsible for the disease. The couple is thrilled with their baby.</p>

            <p class="client_description"> Joanna and Marco really wanted their son to be handsome, smart, healthy and
                athletic. The kinlab team knew exactly which traits to select to make the perfect baby. Initially Joanna
                was skeptical about our process but the results speak for themselves. </p>

                As an only child, John was faced with the pressure to deliver grandkids to his parents to carry on the
                family name. But when Tim married his husband Mike, having biological children seemed to be out of the
                question. After discovering kinlab, Tim & MIke were ecstatic to have a baby.
